Analysis Summary:

A few notes before I begin:
I really struggles with this challenge and did not get a chance to meet with a tutor. I know it is not 100% completed and I own that.

I analyzed data provided for schools within a district.  The overall district data shows that there are 15 schools within the district with 39,170 total students, and a total district budget of $26,649,428.  The average math score is almost a 79%. The average reading score is almost 82%.  At the district level, 75% of the students are passing math, 85% are passing reading, and 65% are passing both.

The district has two types of schools:  district and charter schools. I dissected the data to show the following information per school:  student count, school budget, per capita budget, average math score, average reading score, percentage of students passing math, reading, and both combined.  The top 5 highest performing schools were charter schools, and the bottom 5 lowest performing schools were district schools.

Two conclusions that I can draw from this data are the following: One is that charter schools on average had a lower budget but students performed better.  The other conclusion is that the higher the student count, the students did not perform as well as schools with lower student count.
